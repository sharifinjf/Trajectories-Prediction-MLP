Certainly! Here's a caption that you can use for your GitHub repository to describe an example of trajectory prediction:

.  [**Trajectory Prediction Example:**]: Represents the past trajectory of the object.

•  [**Green**]: Indicates the ground truth path the object followed.

•  [**Red**]: Shows the predicted future trajectory based on the model.
